Rich (BB code):
_FWDT(WDT_OFF);     // Watchdog timer off
I'm going over my knowledge of dsPICs and I'm reading all the Microchip datasheets available.
So far I have downloaded read and searched the following three datasheets.

dsPIC30F4011/4012 Data Sheet
dsPIC30F/33F Programmers Reference Manual
dsPIC® Language Tools Libraries
I was unable to locate any mention of FWDT(WDT_OFF) in any of the above PDFs.
I have left University and now that I have the time I'm going over what I understand about PIC programming. I used the above line of code to turn off the watchdog timer but it was either taken from Microchip example programs or from lecturers examples.
My reason for asking is I would like to know where to find it say fro example if I had no internet access and only the reference manuals I should still be able to locate the necessary syntax etc and build a program from scratch..it would appear to me that I'm missing a manual?
Hop this makes sense!
